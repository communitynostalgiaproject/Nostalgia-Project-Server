# The Ratatouille Moment
This is a description of The Ratatouille Moment project that I'm sure someone will actually flesh out one day.

## Development Setup
1. Fork the repo
2. CD into root directory of the repo and run the command ```npm run install-all```
3. You can then start the entire project, frontend and back using the command ```npm run dev```
4. To run either the frontend or backend separately, use command ```npm run client``` or ```npm run server``` from the root directory
